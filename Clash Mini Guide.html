<h2 id="progression">Progression</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do your quests (especially daily and weekly quests), you should do them in the <strong>expedition road</strong> to not lose trophies, or in mini rooms with your friends or clanmates.</li>
<li>If you want to build up a win streak to get additional trophies, play duel mode because you have a much higher chance of winning than in rumbles.</li>
<li>If you have 1,2k+ trophies, you may consider playing rumbles because you <em>can</em> get many many trophies if you win against players with higher trophies.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="shop">Shop</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remember to always collect your daily free reward!</li>
<li>Buy skill shards and crown shards only in the daily section because they’re discounted</li>
<li>Exchange lower crown shards for higher crown shards</li>
<li>Use your free reroll in the daily section</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="clans">Clans</h3>
<ul>
<li>You should join a clan with clan level 4 because you will have the NIGHTMARE difficulty raid boss unlocked, which gives most rewards. Even if your deck isnt high levled, you should always do Nightmare raids.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="raids">Raids</h3>
<ul>
<li>You should play a deck with huge damage and stun units</li>
<li>Be aware: the monk’s damage is <em>capped</em> at 15, so he won’t take out the raid boss instantly. Monk is still a good option for raids.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<ol>
<li>You don’t have to drag minis onto the board to upgrade them, instead you can tap them and <strong>select the ability you want to upgrade</strong>. This is extremely useful, for example if you want to have the Miner dissipate, you dont have to upgrade to the 1st ability first, instead you can instantly upgrade to the 2nd ability.</li>
<li>You can long press on any units or special tiles on the board to see what they’re doing and what their abilities are.</li>
<li>If you haven’t maxed your minis, check out the “free trial minis” every week because you can play them on max level for free.</li>
<li>You can disable emotes if you find them distracting.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="elixir-management">Elixir Management</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can drag units back to your box to sell them and get elixir</li>
<li>To save rerolls, if you have 0 elixir left but lets say a giant skeleton in your box, and you dont want to play giant skeleton in the next round, you can drag it onto the field and drag it back into your box. If youre lucky in the next round you get a mini you wanted. This is possible because unused minis will stay in your box in the next round and if you sell them, you have a chance to get a different mini than you had in your box.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="good-combos">Good Combos</h3>
<ul>
<li>Barbarian + Archer (+ traning camp) (high attack speed)</li>
<li>Prince + Spear Goblin (destroy gizmos instantly, clash power)</li>
<li>Archer Queen + Lumberjack (rageee)</li>
<li>Countess + Archer (backline b-gone)</li>
<li>Electro Wizard + Sauna (ewiz go crazy)</li>
<li>Royal Champion + Sauna (12 damage shield)</li>
<li>Dart Goblin + Sauna or Training Camp (dartgob go crazy)</li>
<li>Any healing unit + Elixir collector (matches with healers often go into overtime, so the elixir collector can collect maximum amount of elixir</li>
<li>Prince + War Toot (no stun if charge misses)</li>
<li>Wave Master + Pancaker (yeeted units get healed)</li>
<li>2 elixir deck + King Tower (get king tower in round 2)</li>
<li>Shield Maiden + Pancaker (+ healing units) (infinite heal + supers)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="countering-gizmos">Countering Gizmos</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pancaker:</strong> Upgrade anti-heal abilities, or use CLASH ability units on the lanes where your opponents’ troops would be healed, e.g. Pancaker on the right side -&gt; put CLASH units on the left side. This helps because the Pancaker targets the farthest ally.</li>
<li><strong>Pocket Artillery:</strong> Kepp high HP units away from your other units</li>
<li><strong>Hot Pot:</strong> Use ize wizard to slow his attack speed, or use the witch spawning a lot of skeletons to distract him</li>
<li><strong>Sauna:</strong> Your opponent will try to let his carry unit die first to get even more value out of them. That’s why you should try to kill a less important unit first so your opponent doesn’t get the full value out of the sauna</li>
<li><strong>Saint Mirror:</strong> Depends on your deck, if you’re using Monk or Royal Champion, you want to kill it as fast as possible. If you play a deck with healing units, you don’t have to worry much</li>
<li><strong>Training Camp:</strong> Use CLASH units on the lanes left and right of it</li>
<li><strong>Mucho Puncho:</strong> Let Golden Giant or Shield Maiden get punched so they can heal / get energy. You can also block the tiles behind your troop you want to get punched, so it does not fly back to your backlane, but instead stays on the same field.</li>
<li><strong>King Tower:</strong> Use King Tower yourself</li>
<li><strong>War Toot:</strong> Don’t upgrade minis with control effects, because they would be useless</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="countering-units">Countering Units</h3>
<h4 id="heroes">Heroes</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Barbarian King:</strong> Use Stun, Slow, Dissipate units</li>
<li><strong>Countess:</strong> Place units in the corner so she doesn’t get backstab, Use Stun, Slow, Dissipate units, use witch, use Monk</li>
<li><strong>Wave Master:</strong> Place units in the corner so he charges on them, Golden Giant 1st star</li>
<li><strong>Archer Queen:</strong> Use Clash &amp; Block units, archer</li>
<li><strong>Shield Maiden:</strong> Use Stun, Slow, Dissipate units</li>
<li><strong>Monk:</strong> Use giant skeleton, use witch, use ranged units, Use Stun, Slow, Dissipate units, use saint mirror</li>
<li><strong>Royal Champion:</strong> Use Shield Maiden, Golden Giant 1st star</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="minis">Minis</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Archer:</strong> Place a tank unit on your backlane to protect your carry units</li>
<li><strong>Miner:</strong> Place a tank unit on your backlane to protect your carry units</li>
<li><strong>Knight:</strong> Make sure you have minis that deal more than 1 damage</li>
<li><strong>Spear Goblin:</strong> Line up your minis, predict your opponent</li>
<li><strong>Wizard:</strong> Space your units out</li>
<li><strong>Ice Wizard:</strong> Try letting him focus your less important minis that arent designed to deal damage, e.g. giant skeleton</li>
<li><strong>Swordsman:</strong> Dont leave units with no allys nearby as they would be an easy KO and they can even recharge the Swordsman’s super</li>
<li><strong>Skeleton Guard:</strong> Dont focus on him, he wont do much to your units</li>
<li><strong>Barbarian:</strong> Try taking him out in the first 10 seconds because he attacks faster the longer he is on the field</li>
<li><strong>Muskteer:</strong> Clump up your units so no unit will be knocked back because the way is blocked by your other units</li>
<li><strong>Giant Skeleton:</strong> Focus on upgrading your backline, so he wont get much value on your frontline minis</li>
<li><strong>Lumberjack:</strong> Dont focus on him, he wont do much to your units</li>
<li><strong>Mini Pekka:</strong> Try let him focus your units without energy so he cant dissipate anything, keep your heroes in the back</li>
<li><strong>Dart Goblin:</strong> Take him out quick or he will take out your whole team because he will go crazy in the last seconds of the match</li>
<li><strong>Bowler:</strong> 2nd and 4th lane are safer zones because many players play bowler in the middle or on the sides, but keep attention to special tiles</li>
<li><strong>Healing Ranger:</strong> Use antiheal from countess, wizard, valk, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Valkyrie:</strong> Space your units out so she doesnt stack attack speed</li>
<li><strong>Golden Giant:</strong> Dont stun him</li>
<li><strong>Fisherman:</strong> Try to predict it, 2nd and 4th lane are safer zones</li>
<li><strong>Prince:</strong> Have <em>multiple</em> tanks infront of your carries because if you only have one tank, he will get yeeted to your backline so your carries are in big danger, try to predict the enemy placements, line up your units</li>
<li><strong>Pekka:</strong> Use burst damage or clash abilities, try to stun or slow him, or yeet him to the backline using a prince</li>
<li><strong>Magic Archer:</strong> Space your units out, don’t place multiple units in the same lane</li>
<li><strong>Battle Healer:</strong> Use antiheal from countess, wizard, valk, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Mega Knight:</strong> Use burst damage or clash abilities, try to stun or slow him, or yeet him to the backline using a prince</li>
<li><strong>Electro Wizard:</strong> Try to get more units onto the board in front of your carries, try to snipe him with clash abilities or use the witch</li>
<li><strong>Witch:</strong> Use units with fast attack speed and boast like dart goblin or valk because they take huge advantage of the skeletons</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="special-tiles">Special Tiles</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 99% of the matches, use the <strong>revive tile</strong>. If a mini with revive gets killed, it does not activate boast. The skeleton king gets a soul when placed on it, as if he killed a mini, he does not get a 3rd life. Prince on the revive tile is good because if he revives, he can kill the backline without being focused by enemy troops. Dart goblin, barbarian and valk keep their high attack speed when they revive.</li>
<li>The <strong>healing tile</strong> is one of the less impactful tiles in the game. If the enemy has prince, avoid using the tile, if they have bowler or spear goblin, use the tile because they can just heal back up. Healing tiles in the back rows might be good in some situations, e.g. when the enemy has archer, but in most of the cases its good if the tile is in the front row.</li>
<li><strong>Shell tile:</strong> You have to ask yourself if its worth to sacrifice a part of your melee push to infiltrate the backline. Don’t put a unit on it every round, because the shell tile should be a surprise factor. Use the fear of your enemy to your advantage, e.g. if the shell tile is on the left, use clash abilities on the right because your enemy will put his minis away from the shell tile because he  is feared that you use the shell tile. Valkyrie, swordsman, skeleton king, giant skeleton or mega knight can be good on the shell tile. Remember to not put clash ability units on the shell tile because their clash ability wont be activated.</li>
<li>The <strong>electro tile</strong> is quite useless when you play tanks (except mega knight), barbarian king, skeleton king or shield maiden, but it can be useful for ranged minis such as the electro wizard (if protected with tanks in front, of course), countess, monk and royal champion</li>
<li>The mirror tile always mirrors units to the right, so you can take it out easily by playing a clash unit like prince or spear goblin in that lane. If the right side is blocked, it’s mirroring to the left, if the right and left sides are blocked, it’s mirroring to the back, if the right, left, and back sides are blocked, it’s mirroring to the front. Right-&gt;Left-&gt;Back-&gt;Front. If the tile is in the front row, place a giant skeleton for the double bomb, a mini pekka for double burst damage or a prince for extra pressure. If the tile is in the back (3rd or 4th row) place your ranged / carry units on it. Be careful if your enemy has boast units like the skeleton king or the royal champion. If you have skeleton king, <em>always</em> use the mirror tile. SK Clash is the best deck in general for the mirror tile.</li>
